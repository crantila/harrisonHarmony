Description:

This project uses music21 (see http://mit.edu/music21/) to conduct a (currently unsophisticated) analysis of harmonic function in symbolic music notation files, in the still-new style developed by Daniel Harrison (see bibliography) and developed by others. The program currently assumes the entire score is in the same key, as determined by the default music21 key-determination algorithm. The program currently considers only vertical simultaneities (i.e., chords), and has no consideration of even basic contrapuntal behaviour (questions like "does the dominant agent resolve upward by step to the tonic base?") There is very limited support for "applied" harmonies.
